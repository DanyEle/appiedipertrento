Welcome to our App repository. Here you can find all material used for creating our Android Application called APPiedi per Trento (On foot in Trento). We are four students from Liceo Scientifico Galileo Galilei of Trento and we do hope somebody might find our application useful and eventually improve it. If you give it a try, consider submitting your feedback on our Google Play Store page. The license for this project can be found in the "license" text file.
